    "# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game with Dynamic Obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a motified version for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this game, the snake need to eat food and avoid the randomly moving obstacles as well. To achieve this, a `DynamicObstacle` class is created and contained in the files: `dynamic_obstacle.h` and `dynamic_obstacle.cpp` under `/src`. Each `DynamicObstacle` defines one dynamic obstacle that once the `simulate()` function is called, it will pick the direction and speed randomly for next movement. In the game, multiple dyanmic obstacles are defined and run parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the `dynamic_obstacle.h` and `dynamic_obstacle.cpp`, all the changes in original files are marked as `FP`, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `FP.1a` changes in `game.h` to add dynamic obstacle. Others that do the same thing are: `FP.1b`(`game.cpp`), `FP.1c`(`render.cpp`), `FP.1d`(`render.h`).\n",
    "2. `FP.2a` and `FP.2b` are changes in game.h and game.cpp to detect whether the snake head hit the obstacle. If yes, the game is terminated as well.\n",
